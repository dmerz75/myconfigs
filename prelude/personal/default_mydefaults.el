;; To change the default font for new (non special-display) frames,
;; put either of these in your init file:
(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font .  "Mono-10" ))
(set-face-attribute 'default t :font  "Mono-10" )

;; To change the default font for the current frame, as well as future frames,
;; put either of these in your init file:
(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font  "Mono-10" )
(set-frame-font   "Mono-10" nil t)

;; (print (font-family-list))
;; Mono-10
;; -- ok.
;; Proggy Square 80
;; -- doesn't work.

;; The simplest way to set the Emacs font is just to add the following in your .emacs (or init.el):
;; (set-default-font "Inconsolata-12")
;; This code will set the Emacs font to Inconsolata (my favorite monospaced font) with font size 12pt.
;; The problem with this approach is that it will not work with a X Emacs client (emacsclient -c)
;; connecting to an Emacs daemon (emacs â€”daemon), because the code will get run when the server
;; starts and will basically mean nothing to it. You can alleviate this problem by using the
;; appropriate hook for X clients, but I find this distasteful. A much simpler solution is to forget
;; about set-default-font altogether and simply create a file named .Xdefaults in your home folder.
;; Put the following in it:

;; Emacs.font: Inconsolata-12
;; $ xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults
;; At this point you can start Emacs (in normal or daemon mode) and your new font settings should be in effect.
